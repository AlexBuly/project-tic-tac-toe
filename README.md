# project-tic-tac-toe
This is a tic-tac-toe project. The game consists of 2 users, on X and the other O. Players play on a 3x3 board. Players take turns placing their letter. The player to get 3 squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally filled wins. 

Players can fill click a spot to click to place their letter, choose X or O. 

First, the game was setup in the console. Using an under score as a placeholder, the splice function was used. The user first had to specify which row they wanted to place their token, then choose the
column and finally, choose what value to push to into the arrray. 

Once the console version was finished, an on-screen verison was added. The on-screen verison contains functions for the game board, game logic, the board cells, and the display. Factory functions are used to create objects that handle the structural aspects of the game. 

After the game was finished, a dropdown menu was added to control the color of the the X and O tokens. 

Finally, media queries were added to handle smaller screen sizes.
